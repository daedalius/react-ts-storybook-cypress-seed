# Just another seed for mine and your React projects 🤗

## What is in the box? 📦

- Not a Solid🐍 or a 💎🐕
- React
- Typescript
- Webpack 4 (not 5 because of Storybook)
- Storybook
- Cypress
- Jest
- React Testing Library

✅ Storybook and Cypress runs on the Webpack config provided.

## Misc and tweaks

- Some image loading
- Some Prettier config
- Some Storybook helper functions to easily describe Stories in CSF-format
- Changed Storybook Docs global render (you may remove "docs" section from "parameters" in ./storybook/preview.js file)
- Two tsconfigs to avoid [Cypress/Jest typings collision](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-and-jest-typescript-example)
